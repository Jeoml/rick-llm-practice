üöÄ What is Rick LLM?
Rick LLM is a fun and educational project where you fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B to speak in Rick Sanchez‚Äôs chaotic, sarcastic style. You'll:

Create a custom dataset from Rick and Morty transcripts (in ShareGPT format)

Finetune Llama using LoRA with Unsloth

Deploy and chat with your Rickified model using Ollama

"Sometimes science is more art than science, Morty."

üß† How It Works
1. Dataset Creation
Transcripts are cleaned and formatted as instruction-style data

Optionally pushed to Hugging Face for reusability

Script: src/dataset.py

2. Model Finetuning
Performed using Unsloth and LoRA

Hosted on GPU via Lambda Labs

Code: src/rick_llm/

3. Deployment via Ollama
Finetuned model is converted to GGUF + Modelfile

Loaded into Ollama for local chat experience

‚öôÔ∏è Setup
Create a .env file with:

bash
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token"
LAMBDA_API_KEY="your_lambda_api_key"
üõ†Ô∏è Run the Project (Summary)
bash
